## User Stories

I start reading the definitions and try to guess what they are. And then I write the words in the boxes. Then my iputs gets evaluated. If at least 5 of them in a limited time and they are correct then I pass to the next game. If I fail I lose points. If I use all my chances then I restart with the same definitions.
