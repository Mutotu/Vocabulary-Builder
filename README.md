## User Stories

A user starts reading the definitions and try to guess what they are. And then the user drags the words into the boxes. Then their iputs get evaluated. If at least 4 of them in a limited time are correct then they pass to the next game. If the user fails, they lose points. If the user uses all their chances then the user gets eaten by the monster.
